🔐 Foundations of Cybersecurity (Simple Explanation)
1️⃣ What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, systems, and data from attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

Example:
Protecting your Facebook account from being hacked.

2️⃣ Why is Cybersecurity Important?

Because today:

We use the internet for banking, education, communication

Hackers try to steal data, money, or control systems

Without cybersecurity:

Personal data can be stolen

Companies can lose millions

Governments can be attacked

3️⃣ Key Cybersecurity Terms

Threat: Anything that can cause harm
Example: Hacker, malware

Vulnerability: A weakness
Example: Weak password, outdated software

Risk: The chance that a threat will exploit a vulnerability

👉 Simple formula:

Risk = Threat + Vulnerability

4️⃣ CIA Triad (Very Important ⭐)

Cybersecurity is based on three principles:

Confidentiality
→ Only authorized people can access data
Example: Password protection

Integrity
→ Data should not be changed without permission
Example: Detecting if a file was modified

Availability
→ Systems and data should be available when needed
Example: Website should not go down

5️⃣ Types of Cyber Attacks (Basics)

Phishing – Fake emails or messages

Malware – Virus, Trojan, ransomware

Password attacks – Brute force, credential stuffing

DoS/DDoS – Making a service unavailable

6️⃣ Role of a Security Analyst

A security analyst:

Monitors systems for threats

Investigates security incidents

Protects networks and data

Follows security policies and laws

7️⃣ Ethical Responsibility

Cybersecurity professionals must:

Act ethically

Follow laws and policies

Protect privacy

Never misuse access

✅ Key Takeaway

Cybersecurity is about protecting data, systems, and people using technology, processes, and ethical responsibility.
